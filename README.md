This contains the code to analyze edges using the MGWE and MSWE method

Running the code itself is relatively trivial, however, it relies upon
raxml and phyx. The location or raxml and the phyx programs pxbp, pxrr
and pxrmt can be found

To run the program adjust the config.test file as necessary
and run: 'perl MGWE_Calc.pl ExampleMGWE.config'
